title = 'Automated Desktop Setup'
+++

Triggered by this fall's release of OpenBSD, I once again grabbed my 2018 ThinkPad x270 and installed version 7.8 on it.

In order to make it stick, I decided to automate my desktop setup using [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) and other [suckless](https://suckless.org/) tools. The result is my GitHub repository [OpenBSD Playbooks](https://github.com/patrickbucher/openbsd-playbooks), which allows me to setup a convenient working environment after the basic setup within minutes.

However, I use Alacritty instead of the [st](https://st.suckless.org/) terminal, because the latter has some issues with unicode input. I'm also used to a scrollback buffer, so st is a bit too simplistic for me.

I'm currently working through [Httpd and Relayd Mastery](https://www.tiltedwindmillpress.com/product/httpd-and-relayd-mastery/) by Michael W. Lucas, so stay tuned for some blog posts on the OpenBSD web stack.

I also started reading the early access eBook of [The Book of PF](https://nostarch.com/book-of-pf-4th-edition), whose fourth edition will be released in January. I already have a workable pf config on this laptop, which I'ld like to blog about in the upcoming days.
