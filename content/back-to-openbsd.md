I haven't been fiddling arount with OpenBSD for a while. I tried it out numerous times, but it never got serious. Now I'd like to use it again, but this time I'm going to document what I learn.

I'll start with tmux, for which I just got the ebook [tmux 3. Productive Mouse-Free Development](https://pragprog.com/titles/bhtmux3/tmux-3/).

There's also an old laptop (from early 2018) I'd like to use for my experiments. I gave it to my wife years ago, because I got a newer one. Now that she's got another one (she needed a touchscreen), I have it back. It's a Lenovo ThinkPad X270 with a 12.5" screen.

Unfortunately, it has a Swiss keyboard. But since the battery is also rather old, I'll mostly use it at home, plugged in to my docking station, to which a Unicomp keyboard is attached. I was unable to find any replacement parts (new battery, US keyboard) for it, so it will rather serve as a workstation than a mobile computer.

I don't plan to install a GUI at the beginning and stick to tmux instead. Besides finally learning the Korn Shell, I'd also like to do my programming experiments with Elixir on it. (Clojure would probably be too painful on it, so it's also some kind of stress test for the Elixir development experience.) I also felt some itch to try out Zig, but that has to wait a bit longer.

Enough talking, on towards the setup! The USB dongle with the OpenBSD 7.7 image awaits me and my old laptop.
